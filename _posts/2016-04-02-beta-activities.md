The time during internal and public beta release reviews 
is often the first time that partners and friends have 
substantial hands-on experience with the upcoming version.

I think too many developers waste the opportunity
to build goodwill and additional assistance that beta participants can provide.

Here is my advice:

0. <a href="#Define"> Define actors and use cases</a>
0. <a href="#Automate"> Automate use case flows by each actor</a>
0. <a href="#Capture"> Capture detailed factual proof points
0. <a href="#Detail"> Detail history of run speeds</a>
0. <a href="#Help"> Help those who participate</a>
0. <a href="#Delegate"> Delegate socialization of specifics</a>
0. <a href="#Track"> Make it easy to track progress and get reports</a>

More about each is described below.

<a name="Define"></a>

### Define actors and use cases

   Too many organizations release only the software and
   expect everyone to just figure it out.

   This results in not enough coverage simply because people don't
   know about all the features.

   Clarification of who is being served and what each does would
   provide a richer jumping point for suggestions.

<a name="Automate"></a>

### Automate use case flows by each actor

   Automation of keystrokes are useful not just for testing.

   Ideally, automation activities should start 

   Being able to run the demo sequence automatically would provide 
   <strong>salespeople and others confidence</strong> 
   that their live demo actually works
   rather than having to say sorry.

   Having automated use-case runs also helps to speed the development of
   <strong>product vidoes</strong> needed for not just launch but
   throughout the product lifecycle.

   The more people who views a video, 
   the more varied the extent of feedback.

<a name="Capture"></a>

### Capture detailed factual proof points

   General platitudes like "oh it's great" does a marketer no good.

   What are needed are "sound bites" and quotes that can be published.

   So we want to encourage beta reviewers to 
   take measurements before, during, and after demo activities.

   Valid measurements require planning and discipline,
   and that takes pre-planning and encouragement before and 
   all the way through the process.

<a name="Detail"></a>

### Detail history of run speeds

   It would be useful to have timings captured during each automated run
   so that anomalies can be identified early,
   and comparisons have more data points over time and varying conditions.

   Then if somone complains that a particular run seemed slow,
   troubleshooting can include comparison against previous runs
   at various points in various environments.

<a name="Help"></a>

### Help those who participated

   Many consultants make hay from the fact that they had a hand in the creation of
   the product.

   So have a webpage that acknowledges their participation so they can point to 
   proof that they mattered.

   Some beta participants had to fight hard 
   to get approval for taking time to participate.

   So a letter or email to their bosses from one senior manager to another
   would go a long way to ensure continued enthusiam in the future.

   Such communication is an opportunity to "sell" the product,
   and contribute to continued willingness to pay maintenance fees.

   As importantly, help beta participants avoid the need to run through a gauntlet
   of inexperience people when technical support is needed.

<a name="Delegate"></a>

### Delegate socialization of specifics

   It takes a tremendous amount of time to stay in touch and clarify feedback.

   Consider "deputizing" select individuals ("ambassadors") 
   from among the user community to
   take responsibility for communicating personally with his/her peers
   about the demo.

   This can be emails or, better yet, regular phone calls and
   video conference calls.

   It helps if communication events are planned ahead,
   with several reminders ahead of each event,
   and follow-ups after.

<a name="Track"></a>

### Make it easy to track progress and get reports

   Provide a system for demo participants to track their 
   activities and communications.

   Make it easy by providing a special "bcc" address for 
   ambassadors when they send out emails.

   A system can then parse emails to collate the information,
   and present it in reports.

   Design the tracking and reports based on specific actors and use case
   flows so decisions and actions can be specifically actionable.
