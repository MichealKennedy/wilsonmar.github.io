## The Good News about Markdown

Markdown is easier to write than HTML.

   * No need for `<p>` to force a new line. Just a blank line will do.


CAUTION: Even though HTML can be written or pasted into markdown (.md) files,
HTML must be more correct than HTML read by internet browsers.

* For every `<li>` there needs to be a `</li>` or the rendering goes wacky.

* There must be at least one space between `<div>` and `</div>` tags.

* There must be a blank line after anchor tags `<a name=...` and a heading text line.

* There must be a blank line before `<ul`.

Markdown text is different than HTML in several ways:

* No need use HTML. However, to get links to open on a new window 
  (rather than let the new page hijack user attention),
  continue to use `<a taget="_blank' href=`.
