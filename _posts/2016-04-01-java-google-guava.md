Among the billions of libraries on GitHub,
this one is #2 behind Log4J.

Although nearly 9,000 have starred it at time of writing,
only around 1,000 are watching it.

Here are my notes as I learn how to use the library.

Not just to have it on my resume, but because I think that's what it takes to be a good and fast Java programmer today.

## What It Is

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki">
   https://github.com/google/guava/wiki</a>
   is the starting point for the various components.

its-most-useful-and-or-hidden-features</a>

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Guava
the library consists of:

1. basic utilities to reduce menial labors to implement common methods and behaviors, 
such as generics (introduced in JDK 1.5) extended with
multisets, multimaps, bimaps, and immutable collections

2. an extension to the Java collections framework (JCF) formerly called the Google Collections Library,

3. other utilities which provide convenient and productive features such as 
functional programming, caching, range objects, and hashing

In other words, you're diving into the "deep end" of Java that real pros use.

Let's learn to swim, then.
